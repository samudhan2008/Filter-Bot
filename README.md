# SC Files Bot

A from-scratch Telegram file-sharing/auto-filter bot for the SC Files project.
Built independently (not a fork) — inspired by the general shape of file-sharing
bots, but the search engine, poster generation, and website-linking logic are
all new.

## What it does

- **Auto-filter search** — type a movie/series name in an authorized group or
  in PM, get back:
  - A Netflix-style landscape poster (TMDB backdrop + title logo, or a text
    fallback if TMDB has no logo for that title)
  - If the search is ambiguous (e.g. "Leo" matches both the Tamil film and an
    English one) and you didn't give a year, you get tappable
    `Title (Year) · LANG` buttons to disambiguate
  - Buttons to grab each matching file (delivered via bot PM)
  - A "Watch on SC Files" button/link **only if** the title is actually on
    scfiles.vercel.app — checked against your backend by `tmdb_id`, so slug
    quirks (`sannidhanam-po` vs `sannidhanam-p.o.`) never cause a false miss
  - If it's not on the website, the admin/log channel gets a heads-up instead
    of showing the user a dead link
- **Fixed search matching** — the old bot missed files that existed in the DB
  because `.`, `-`, `_`, `+` etc weren't stripped consistently between the
  query and stored filenames. This version normalizes both sides the same
  way before matching, so punctuation never breaks a search.
- **Fast `/index`** — bulk-inserts files in batches of 200 instead of one
  DB round-trip per file.
- **Admin-authorization flow** — group admins run `/authorize` to let the bot
  respond in their group; `/unauthorize` revokes it.
- **Force-subscribe** to a channel before anyone can search.
- **URL shortener** — optional, wraps the SC Files links if `SHORTLINK_MODE`
  is on.
- **Admin tools** — `/ban`, `/unban`, `/broadcast` (users or groups),
  `/stats`, `/logs`.

## What was intentionally removed

- The old `/filters` (per-group custom auto-reply) and `/gfilters` (global
  filter) commands are gone, per your call — `/index` is the only ingestion
  path now, and it's the one that got the speed work.

## Backend contract

Set `BACKEND_URL` to your SC Files API host. The bot calls:

- `GET {BACKEND_URL}/api/movies` → list of `{tmdb_id, id, downloads, subtitles, extras}`
- `GET {BACKEND_URL}/api/series` → list of `{tmdb_id, id, seasons: [...]}`

Both are cached in memory for `BACKEND_CACHE_TTL` seconds (default 300) to
avoid hammering your API on every search.

Matching is **primarily by `tmdb_id`** — the backend's own `id` field is used
verbatim for the website link, so the bot never has to guess a slug. A fuzzy
fallback (`difflib`, 82% similarity threshold) only kicks in if an entry has
no usable `tmdb_id`.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `BOT_TOKEN` | ✅ | from my.telegram.org / @BotFather |
| `DATABASE_URI` | ✅ | MongoDB connection string |
| `DATABASE_NAME`, `COLLECTION_NAME` | – | defaults provided |
| `ADMINS` | ✅ | space-separated Telegram user IDs |
| `LOG_CHANNEL` | recommended | where indexing logs + "not on website" alerts go |
| `AUTH_CHANNEL` | optional | force-subscribe channel ID |
| `AUTH_GROUPS` | optional | space-separated group IDs; if set, only these groups work and `/authorize` is bypassed. Leave unset to use the DB-driven `/authorize` flow instead. |
| `BACKEND_URL` | ✅ for website links | e.g. `https://api.scfiles.example.com` |
| `WEBSITE_URL` | – | default `https://scfiles.vercel.app` |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | ✅ | https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api |
| `SHORTLINK_MODE`, `SHORTLINK_URL`, `SHORTLINK_API` | optional | e.g. `tnshort.net` |
| `PROTECT_CONTENT` | optional | `True` to block forwarding/saving of files |
| `MAX_RESULTS` | – | default 10 |

## Notes / things worth double-checking before you go live

- I haven't run this against a live Telegram bot token or your real MongoDB/
  backend — I don't have credentials or network access to those services
  here, so this hasn't been integration-tested end-to-end. Compiles clean,
  logic is straightforward, but please test `/index` on a small channel and
  a few searches (including a deliberately ambiguous one like "Leo") before
  pointing it at your real audience.
- The TMDB "which language wins" heuristic is Tamil-first (matches your use
  case) — tweak `PREFERRED_LANGS` in `utils/tmdb.py` if that's ever wrong.
- Disambiguation buttons currently always show when TMDB returns more than
  one candidate and no year was given, per what you asked for. If that ends
  up too chatty for very common titles, `_is_unambiguous()` in
  `plugins/search.py` is the one place to loosen it.
